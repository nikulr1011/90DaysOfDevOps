My 90-Day DevOps and Cloud Learning Plan
Current Level
I am an MSc IT student and a Experience. I have basic knowledge of programming, Git, and Linix, Cloud and IT Audit. Now I want to focus on DevOps and Cloud to build skills that are useful in real industry work.

My Understanding of DevOps and Cloud
For me, DevOps means improving the process of building, testing, and deploying applications by using automation and better collaboration between teams. Cloud helps us run and manage applications on online servers without worrying about physical hardware.

Why I Am Learning DevOps and Cloud
I am learning DevOps because I am interested in automation, servers, and deployment processes. I also want to move my career in DevOps, CloudOps and Cloud Security aand work on real production systems.

Goals for the Next 90 Days
Learn Docker and containerize simple applications.
Build CI/CD pipelines to automate build and deployment.
Deploy an application on cloud using Kubernetes and basic AWS services.
Core Skills I Want to Improve
Linux usage and basic troubleshooting
CI/CD pipeline creation and automation
Docker and Kubernetes deployment and debugging

Weekly Time Plan
On weekdays, I will study around 1 to 2 hours daily. On weekends, I will give around 3 to 4 hours for practice and revision.

How I Will Stay Consistent
I will try to study every day even if the time is less.
I will focus more on hands-on practice instead of only watching videos.
I will revise weekly and note down what I need to improve.
I will share my learning progress on LinkedIn to stay motivated.
Final Commitment
For the next 90 days, I will follow this plan seriously and complete all tasks. My focus will be on learning by doing and improving step by step.
